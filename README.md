I was planning to use this to convert SDF files generated with: https://github.com/andreasBihlmaier/FusionSDF to URDF

It built but I was getting this error:

```
/Test Rig/model.sdf. Aborting.

SDF contains 0 instead of exactly one model. Aborting.
[ros2run]: Process exited with failure 1
```

I am going to look into using a direct fusion360 to URDF converted instead: https://github.com/syuntoku14/fusion2urdf
